# WASM
Web Assembly allows developers to compile languages like C, C++ and Rust in binary format (.wasm files). 
These then can be use to in web browsers, as WebAssembly supports this functionality and allows lanugages other than Javascript, to be used for web development.

It also supports non-browser environments due to its features.

It has 4 key features :-
1. Portability -> It is designed to to run in the same way across different environments (Browsers, servers, edge computers, etc..)
2. Performance -> Due to its low level, using hardware properties, it works at high speed.
3. Security -> WASM is sandboxed, hence provide a safe isolated environment.
4. Interoperability -> It can interact with JS, allowing native performance on browsers :)

It really is cool !!
